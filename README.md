### What I'm currently working on

- [Ublue-tj5miniop ](https://github.com/tj5miniop/ublue-rolling-images) - Customized base (but daily-drivable) images of the Universal Blue project. Currently building - Bluefin, Bazzite & Aurora.
- [Hyperion ](https://github.com/tj5miniop/hyperion) - A ressurected project, built using the same techniques as Ublue-tj5minop, but setup from scratch. Hyperion uses a CachyOS-like kernel (https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/whitehara/kernel-cachyos-preempt/) and official patches, along with Steam and the Brave browser. Based on Fedora Kinoite
- [CachyOS (kinda) in a container](https://github.com/tj5miniop/cachy-container-image) - Cachy OS based variant of the Bazzite Arch container, allowing the best container gaming experience, courtesy of distrobox. Will include many tools
### upcoming projects  

-  OBS in a container?
-  Steam Proton Patcher?
-  SteamOS-like linux desktop, with an NVIDIA GPU optimised focus?
-  more to come......
